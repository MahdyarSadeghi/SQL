## Covid Data Exploration
I downloaded covid data from [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and split into two tables. One of them contained some information about vaccination in each country and the other one contained number of deaths and sufferers. I calculated some important KPIs that to understand Covid status in each country.

## Online Shop Data Exploration
During this project, I designed an ER Diagram using Visio, then I generated data using pandas, numpy, faker libraries in Python and after importing ER Diagram and data in SQL Server I prepared appropriate KPIs and created suitable SQL queries to calculate the KPIs.
