# SQL

### Covid Data Exploration
I downloaded covid data from here and split into two tables. One of them contained some information about vaccination in each country and the other one contained number of deaths and sufferers. I calculated some important KPIs that to understand Covid status in each country.

### Online Shop Exploration
During this project, I designed an ER Diagram using Visio, then I generated data using pandas, numpy, faker libraries in Python and after importing ER Diagram and data in SQL Server, and creating appropriate KPIs, I created SQL queries.
